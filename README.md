# LeetCode Solutions & Learning Notes

Hello there! I'm Pedro, a computer engineering student that dreams of being a Software Engineer some day. Welcome to my repository where I store my **LeetCode** solutions and document my study process! The main goal of this repo is to **learn by doing**, and also to keep a record of the knowledge and insights I gain along the way.

## Introduction

LeetCode is a fantastic platform to strengthen problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and deepen understanding of programming concepts. This repository contains:

- **Problem Solutions**: My code implementations for LeetCode problems.
- **Study Notes**: Markdown files detailing insights, resources, and step-by-step learnings whenever I dive deeper into specific concepts needed to solve problems.

I aim to keep each solution **clear**, **well-documented**, and **modular**, so that anyone (including my future self) can revisit the code to understand how and why a particular approach was taken.

## How the Repo is Organized

Below is the proposed folder structure for the repository:

### Folder & File Breakdown

- **`<PlaylistName>/`**: Each recommended LeetCode playlist will have it's own dedicated directory.
- **`<ProblemName>/`**: Each problem will have a dedicated directory as well, containing all the material I've used and developed to study and solve each problem.

  - **`<ProblemName>.c`** (or `.py`, `.js`, etc. depending on the language): Contains the solution source code.
  - **`<ProblemName>.md`**: Contains a high-level description of the problem, the reasoning behind the solution, time/space complexity analysis, and alternative approaches (if any).

- **`study-materials/`**: Contains topic-specific notes or tutorials that I create while researching how to solve certain problems. For example, if I needed a refresher on dynamic programming, I'd create a `dynamic-programming.md` here to document all the details learned in the process.

## How to Use These Solutions

1. **Browse by Problem**: Navigate into a folder named after the LeetCode problem to see both the solution code and a brief explanation (`.md` file).
2. **Check the Explanation**: Read the `.md` file inside each problem folder for a step-by-step breakdown of the approach, algorithm analysis, and possible improvements.
3. **Study the Concepts**: If you want more insight into the background knowledge needed (e.g., certain data structures, algorithms, or math concepts), refer to the `study-materials/` folder where I keep more in-depth notes.

**Disclaimer**: Always **verify the correctness** of any solution by running your own tests. While I do my best to ensure accuracy, double-checking is part of the learning process!

## Study Notes & Process

If I discover a gap in my knowledge while solving a problem, I’ll:

1. Research the topic (using official documentation, reputable tutorials, etc.).
2. Take notes in a dedicated Markdown file under `study-materials/`.
3. Apply that knowledge to solve (or optimize) the LeetCode problem.
4. Update the solution folder with a relevant write-up.

By systematically documenting each new concept, I intend to build a comprehensive resource for my own reference and for others who might find it helpful.
